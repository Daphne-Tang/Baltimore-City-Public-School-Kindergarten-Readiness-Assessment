## Background
[Kindergarten readiness](https://www.unitedway.org/blog/kindergarten-readiness-why-is-it-important#:~:text=The%20first%20few%20years%20of,%2C%20counting%2C%20and%20social%20interaction.) influences the academic success of students because foundational academic and social skills improve their abilities to adapt and flourish in new school environments. Reading, writing, and math skills would enable students to understand new concepts more easily, and strong social interaction capabilities would facilitate cooperation with peers. However, there are discrepancies in kindergarten readiness due to different socioeconomic backgrounds, forms of prior care, and levels of language fluency. Students who are economically disadvantaged, lack prior care, or are non-native English speakers face greater challenges in achieving readiness for kindergarten curriculums. This analysis seeks to understand what solutions Baltimore City Public Schools should implement to address those concerns. 

Baltimore City has already invested in early learning programs like [Judy Centers](https://earlychildhood.marylandpublicschools.org/families/judy-centers) that provide pre-kindergarten classrooms, child care assistance, developmental and health screenings, family enagement activities, parenting classes, and play groups. The Judy Centers address the needs of both students and families to provide multiple forms of support in a child's academic and social development. Comparing the impact of Baltimore City early learning programs with traditional child care centers, home care, or other public settings could generate insights into the successes, challenges, and strategies for improvement. 

## Business Question
How should Baltimore City allocate resources to improve kindergarten readiness for its public schools? 

## Data Question - Open Data
This analysis uses data from [Baltimore City Public Schools](https://www.baltimorecityschools.org/data) about student achievement. We wanted to analyze the preparation of students entering Baltimore City Public Schools, so we explored districtwide results for the Maryland State Department of Education Kindergarten Readiness Assessment in 2019-2020. Students take the exam early in their kindergarten year and receive scores on math, language arts, social development, and physical well-being. In contrast to other Maryland counties that only administered the exam to small samples, Baltimore City tested all kindergarten students.

The dataset includes the following for each school and student group: 
- Test Takers With Overall Score
- Average Scale Score
- Average Language and Literacy Score
- Average Math Score
- Average Physical Development Score
- Average Social Foundations Score
- Percent Emerging Readiness
- Percent Approaching Readiness
- Percent Demonstrating Readiness

The student groups include the following: 
- All students
- Economic Disadvantaged: Yes
- English Learners: Yes
- Gender: Female
- Gender: Male
- Prior Care: Baltimore City Public Schools Pre-K

## Data Question - Analysis
This analysis uses Microsoft Excel to answer the following questions:
- How prepared are kindergarten students who enter Baltimore City Public Schools in math, language and literacy, physical development, and social foundations? How do results differ from students who are economically disadvantaged, non-native English speakers, and have different types of prior care?
- How can we group Baltimore City Schools based on the readiness of their kindergarten students?
