## Pivot Tables and Graphs
The pivot tables seek to represent the average scores and percent readiness for the different student groups. 
1. Select all of the data and click "Insert Pivot Table" to create a pivot table in a new worksheet. 
2. Here are the settings for the pivot table: 
- Rows: Student Group
- Columns: Values
- Values: 
  - Average of Average Scale Score
  - Average of Average Language and Literacy Score
  - Average of Average Math Score
  - Average of Average Physical Development Score
  - Average of Average Social Foundations Score

Hide the row called Race: Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander because there is insufficient data. The values in the pivot table end up being #DIV/O!

3. Create pivot table graphs highlighting the average scores across all skills for different student groups. Here are the steps using prior care and average scale score as an example: 
- Copy and paste the data that you would like on the graph
- Highlight the data and insert bar chart. 
- Rename the title, horizontal axis, and vertical axis
